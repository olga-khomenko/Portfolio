## About me
Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio - I am Olga Khomenko, an ISTQB certified QA specialist, open to grow and develop.
After working for years in office administration, the covid time made me re-evaluate my professional goals and gave me courage to make a strong step towards Quality Assurance.  I was always fascinated with what modern programming tools can do now, how automation can simplify our life. In my previous positions, while working with a lot of numbers and data, I mastered  my detail-orientation skills and communication. Moreover, I always tried to automate my work processes as much as possible. 
 After finishing Python Development and QA Automation Bootcamps I am looking forward to improving the quality of your product by covering its frontend and backend  functionalities with reliable end-to-end automated testing. I took some time to build my demo projects portfolio that can showcase my coding skills in writing automated tests and documentation and I’m highly encouraging you to spend some time to explore my work.
