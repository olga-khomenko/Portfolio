## About me
__Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio - I am Olga Khomenko, an ISTQB certified QA specialist, open to grow and develop.__

After working for years in office administration, the covid time made me re-evaluate my professional goals and gave me courage to make a strong step towards Quality Assurance.  I was always fascinated with what modern programming tools can do now, how automation can simplify our life. In my previous positions, while working with a lot of numbers and data, I mastered  my detail-orientation skills and communication. Moreover, I always tried to automate my work processes as much as possible. 

 Once I've finished Python Development and QA Automation Bootcamps I am looking forward to improving the quality of your product by validaing its frontend and backend  functionalities.
